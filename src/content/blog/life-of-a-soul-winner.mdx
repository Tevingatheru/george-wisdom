The mandate of fulfilling the Great Commission is not restricted to Evangelists alone. 
It is 'The Kingdom Mandate' with every believer and all the five-fold ministers. However, this World we live in is ruled by the prince of darkness and hence soul winning has been downplayed. 

Not many preachers want to tell men to repent of their sins, they are  more focused on making everybody comfortable in Church. Particularly so because of material gain! However, for us who appreciate the value of a Soul. It ought to be different. 

The driving force should be compassion and love beyond the temporary benefits. 
We therefore need to invest ourselves spiritually into this gruelling terrain of wrestling with demonic strongholds until the bound are set free and the blinded see the Light of Christ! 

This calls for a deeper life of Prayer, Intercession and Spiritual Warfare. 
We ought to be perpetually aware that our battles are first and foremost won in the Spiritual Realms before the Physical Manifestation. The Take-Over is primarily at the gates of the enemy before the Captives in the inner chambers of detention can be freed. 
We must occupy space in the spiritual atmosphere before we occupy the physical habitations of men. 

Let us borrow the example of Our Master, the Lord Jesus Christ! For way before dawn. He would withdraw to a solitary place to begin addressing the strongholds and territorial hoodlums of the enemy. And when he descends to the villages all resistance would be rendered powerless. 

The results would be phenomenal. When I look at the lives of our mentors like.... : .Benny, Bonnke, Osborn, Wairimu, Finney, ..just to mention a few. Their lives were and still are lived on the knees, literally.
Fellow bond-servants of Christ, if we desire a different results we must build Prayerfully and Sacrificially.
